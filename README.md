🛡️ Cloud Security Engineer Roadmap (Self-Paced & GitHub Portfolio)
🌟 Why This Exists

This roadmap is a strategic, self-paced journey to becoming a cloud security engineer, curated to build hands-on skills, validate expertise through certifications, and demonstrate real-world capabilities in a public portfolio. It serves both as a learning guide and evidence of progress for future employers and collaborators.

🔑 Core Focus Areas
Area	Why It Matters
Cloud Platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)	Must understand native security services and architectural best practices
Identity & Access Management (IAM)	First line of defense; misconfigurations are a top attack vector
Infrastructure as Code (IaC)	Automate and secure provisioning at scale (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation)
Cloud Threat Detection	Learn SIEM, CSPM, and monitoring tools like GuardDuty, Azure Sentinel
Encryption & Key Management	Core to data protection in transit and at rest
Compliance & Governance	Understand frameworks like NIST, SOC2, ISO, and cloud shared responsibility model
Incident Response & Forensics	Know how to detect, analyze, and respond in cloud environments
DevSecOps	Integrate security into CI/CD workflows and container security


📜 Certification Goals
Cert	Provider	Level	Value
CompTIA Security+	CompTIA	Entry	Foundational for security principles
AWS Certified Security - Specialty	AWS	Intermediate	Validates deep AWS security knowledge
AZ-500: Microsoft Azure Security Engineer	Microsoft	Intermediate	Azure-specific security skills
Google Professional Cloud Security Engineer	GCP	Intermediate	For GCP-based roles
(Optional) ISC² CCSP	ISC²	Advanced	Vendor-neutral, governance heavy
(Bonus) Terraform Associate	HashiCorp	Intermediate	Shows IaC and cloud provisioning skills
